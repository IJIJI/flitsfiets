# FlitsFiets - Een fiets in een flits!
To gain more experience in developing microservice applications, I am building FlitsFiets: **the** application to get a well-built bike in a flash.

## Brief description
FlitsFiets is a bicycle subscription service. You can choose a subscription plan and pick up the corresponding bike the same day. Within your plan, maintenance is included, for which you can make appointments in the app. For long repairs, you can get a loaner bike within a flash, which you can use while yours is being repaired. FlitsFiets offers its users the guarantee of a functioning bike, always.


# Development
To get started in developing this project first build the common dependencies:
```bash
./mvnw install

```
You can then run the services using:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl frontend
```
